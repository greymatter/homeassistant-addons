# hass_tftp_rw
tftp backup server addon for home assistant


I needed a simple tftp server that allows read and write capabilities so that I can both boot and backup network hardware using tftp.

I plan to use this solution to backup my personal network equipment on a schedule and be able to monitor the status in HA.  I am currently backing up to a old pi that was being used for asterisk but has long since been retired and thats all its doing and it need to be repurposed so this project has come to life.

This project was forked from MartLugt/hass_tftp so big thanks to him for providing a simple framework to get this going with a single change to the command line.
